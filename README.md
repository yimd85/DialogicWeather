## Technical Exercise with Dialogic

Exercise:
Build a webpage to show the weather forecast today and tomorrow for 5 or more cites of your choice.
You should show as a minimum, the daily high and low temperatures.
The following Web Services API will provide you the data you need:

[http://openweathermap.org/forecast16](http://openweathermap.org/forecast16)

As an example here is the URL for weather in London:
[api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London](http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London)

The forecast data is in a JSON format 

This weather data in your web page should update every 10 minutes.
We would prefer that you use Bootstrap and Angular if you can.
How you layout the weather data is your chance to impress us.
